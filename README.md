# Core Features

---

## Automated Evaluation  
- Each sheet is processed in real-time, allowing for batch uploads and efficient grading workflows.
![Automated Evaluation](pictures/auto-eval.png)

- High-accuracy OCR engine extracts answers from scanned handwritten sheets (even with slight noise or skew).
![OCR](pictures/ocr.png)

- Built with PyTesseract and OpenCV for preprocessing, enhanced with error-tolerant logic for poorly scanned images.

---

## Question Classification  
- Questions from uploaded PDFs/DOCX files are auto-categorized using NLP classifiers into:
  - Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs)  
  - Descriptive Questions  
  - Opinion-Based Questions  
![Question Classification](pictures/question-classification.png)
- Ensures contextual understanding, not just keyword-based classification.
- Custom-trained transformer model with fallback rules for edge cases.

---

## RAG-Powered Answer Generation  
- Uses LangChain + Gemini for context-aware answer generation.
- Teachers upload a reference textbook, syllabus, or notes → ideal answers are generated in seconds.
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) ensures content alignment with your source material.

## Custom Rubrics for Grading  
- Teachers define point allocation, required keywords, structure, tone, etc., per question.
- Rubrics are stored per test session, and reused as needed.
- Hybrid grading: ML-based + Rule-based scoring mechanisms.

## Scoring Justification  
- Each score includes a breakdown:

  - Keyword match score

  - Similarity to reference (and all other parameters choosen

  - Structural alignment (for essays)
- Students can be shown this breakdown optionally for transparency.

## Extras

---

### Plagiarism Detection  
- Compares answers across students and online sources using semantic similarity.
- Uses transformer embeddings to catch paraphrased cheating attempts.

--- 

### Answer Quality Grading (A.Q.G.)  
-Scores answers on:
  - Coherence
  - Depth
  - Language use
  - Structural clarity
- A.Q.G. score is separate from the actual score, but helps in holistic assessment.

---

### Smart Chatbot Assistant  
Built-in chatbot helps teachers or students query evaluation results, access rubrics, and get clarification on scoring instantly.

# Flow (Same for both cloud website and android app):
1. Login:

- The user logs in (likely as a teacher or evaluator) by entering student details (scrolling down to the appropriate section).

- Action: Clicks to upload the sample question paper.

2. Upload the Question Paper:

- Action: Selects the sample question paper and clicks "next" after choosing evaluation parameters.

- Purpose: The question paper is uploaded and the system gets ready to evaluate answer sheets based on it.

3. Upload the Answer Sheet:

- Action: Uploads the scanned or digital answer sheet (in PDF or image format).

- Purpose: The system runs OCR (via Tesseract) on the answer sheet, classifies the questions, and prepares for evaluation.

4. System Evaluation:

- Action: The system runs through the answer sheet, classifies the answers, generates ideal answers using LangChain + Gemini, scores the answers, and generates feedback.

5. Result Generation:

- Action: Waits for the results to be processed and then downloads the evaluation report once it’s ready.

6. Return to Dashboard:

- Action: After downloading the report, the user can return to the main dashboard.

---

# Sample Data / Test Flow (Same for both cloud website and android app):
To help with testing, here’s how you can set up sample data and test the flow:

## Sample Files:
(download these files)

- sample/sample-answersheet.pdf

- sample/sample-question-paper.pdf

## Test Flow:

1. Upload the sample answer sheet or a bulk PDF (if there are multiple students).

2. The system:
   
   a) Runs OCR via Tesseract to extract text from the images/PDF.

   b) Classifies the questions based on the question set.

   c) Generates ideal answers using LangChain and Gemini API.

   d) Scores the answers and generates detailed feedback.

4. Teachers can view results in a dashboard, export reports, and see breakdowns of the evaluation.
